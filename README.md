*this is a work in progress*

# cpp_matrix
This is just me making a generic templated C++ matrix class

## Using
**TODO**


## Testing
The code auto runs tests with google cloud build. It will be tested with number types `char`, `unsigned char`, `short`, `unsigned short`, `int`, `unsigned int`, `long`, `unsigned long`, `long long`, `float`, `double`, and `long double`.

## Why
This is a side project to learn the new conding conventions in C++11. My main job is as an embedded C programmer. I plan on using this library to find the best stratagies for playing Settlers of Catan.
